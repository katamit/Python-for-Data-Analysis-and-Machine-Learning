# Python-for-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning

This repo contains the exercises made for the course of Jose Portilla on Udemy.

The course teaches how to use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn , Matplotlib , Plotly , Scikit-Learn , Machine Learning, Tensorflow and more.

The exercises offer the possibility to reproduce the real analysis process using real data (like datasets on Kaggle) or fake data (created for the scope of the course).
